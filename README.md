### Movie Trailer Website

## Overview
This is a minimalistic website that shows trailers of six of my favourite
movies. To generate a website that displays these movies, a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) was provided by the **Udacity FSND Team** - this module has a function called `open_movies_page` that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an `HTML` file which visualizes all of the movies.


## Usage

To open the page:
 - Download the `movie_trailer.zip` file into your local machine
 - Navigate to the location of the folder and unzip it
 - Open the terminal and run `python entertainment_center.py`
 - A webpage should open up wich the posters of the six movie trailers
 - Clieck on any of the posters and a trailer video should open up
 - Engjoy! :)
